However, there are limitations with how humans provide feedback to robots, e.g., humans may give less feedback as interactions progress. Therefore, it would be advantageous if robots could influence humans to provide more feedback during interactions. We conducted a 2x2 between-subjects user study (ùëÅ = 71) to investigate whether the framing and timing of a robot‚Äôs reminder to provide feedback could influence human interactants. Human-robot interactions took place in the context of Space Invaders, a fast-paced and continuous collaborative environment. Our results suggest that reminders can influence the amount of feedback humans provide to robots, how participants feel about the robot, and how they feel about providing feedback during the interaction.","tags":[],"title":"Verbally Soliciting Human Feedback in Continuous Human-Robot Collaboration: Effects of the Framing and Timing of Reminders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qiping Zhang","Austin Narcomey","Kate Candon","Marynel V√°zquez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1678665600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678665600,"objectID":"db00fe0418b897c0ec06bb52a4347a86","permalink":"/publication/photorl-hri22/","publishdate":"2023-03-10T23:34:30-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/photorl-hri22/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent research in robot learning suggests that implicit human feedback is a low-cost approach to improving robot behavior without the typical teaching burden on users. Because implicit feedback can be difficult to interpret, though, we study different methods to collect fine-grained labels from users about robot performance across multiple dimensions, which can then serve to map implicit human feedback to performance values. In particular, we focused on understanding the effects of annotation order and frequency on human perceptions of the self-annotation process and the usefulness of the labels for creating data-driven models to reason about implicit feedback. Our results demonstrate that different annotation methods can influence perceived memory burden, annotation difficulty, and overall annotation time. Based on our findings, we conclude with recommendations to create future implicit feedback datasets in Human-Robot Interaction.","tags":[],"title":"Self-Annotation Methods for Aligning Implicit and Explicit Human Feedback in Human-Robot Interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jake Brawer","Debasmita Ghose","Kate Candon","Meiying Qin","Alessandro Roncone","Marynel V√°zquez","Brian Scassellati"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1678505670,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678505670,"objectID":"95a08494d2046532cba06df3b848aa7b","permalink":"/publication/chefbot-hri22/","publishdate":"2023-03-10T23:34:30-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chefbot-hri22/","section":"publication","summary":"One important aspect of effective human--robot collaborations is the ability for robots to adapt quickly to the needs of humans. While techniques like deep reinforcement learning have demonstrated success as sophisticated tools for learning robot policies, the fluency of human-robot collaborations is often limited by these policies' inability to integrate changes to a user's preferences for the task. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel approach that can modify learned policies at execution time via symbolic if-this-then-that rules corresponding to a modular and superimposable set of low-level constraints on the robot's policy. These rules, which we call Transparent Matrix Overlays, function not only as succinct and explainable descriptions of the robot's current strategy but also as an interface by which a human collaborator can easily alter a robot's policy via verbal commands. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on a series of proof-of-concept cooking tasks performed in simulation and on a physical robot.","tags":[],"title":"Interactive Policy Shaping for Human-Robot Collaboration with Transparent Matrix Overlays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kate Candon","Zoe Hsu","Yoony Kim","Jesse Chen","Nathan Tsoi","Marynel V√°zquez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1670198400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670198400,"objectID":"692cd8a10465b34afc41b0b7a8977f77","permalink":"/publication/perceptions-hai22/","publishdate":"2023-03-10T23:34:30-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/perceptions-hai22/","section":"publication","summary":"Much prior work on creating social agents that assist users relies on preconceived assumptions of what it means to be helpful. For example, it is common to assume that a helpful agent just assists with achieving a user‚Äôs objective. However, as assistive agents become more widespread, human-agent interactions may be more ad-hoc, providing opportunities for unexpected agent assistance. How would this affect human notions of an agent‚Äôs helpfulness? To investigate this question, we conducted an exploratory study (N=186) where participants interacted with agents displaying unexpected, assistive behaviors in a Space Invaders game and we studied factors that may influence perceived helpfulness in these interactions. Our results challenge the idea that human perceptions of the helpfulness of unexpected agent assistance can be derived from a universal, objective definition of help. Also, humans will reciprocate unexpected assistance, but might not always consider that they are in fact helping an agent. Based on our findings, we recommend considering personalization and adaptation when designing future assistive behaviors for prosocial agents that may try to help users in unexpected situations.","tags":[],"title":"Perceptions of the Helpfulness of Unexpected Agent Assistance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nathan Tsoi","Kate Candon","Deyuan Li","Yofti Milkessa","Marynel V√°zquez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1667260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667260800,"objectID":"2fc2331a56602da0e9566bb7fce60a33","permalink":"/publication/btg-neurips22/","publishdate":"2023-03-10T23:34:30-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/btg-neurips22/","section":"publication","summary":"While neural network binary classifiers are often evaluated on metrics such as Accuracy and F1-Score, they are commonly trained with a cross-entropy objective. How can this training-evaluation gap be addressed? While specific techniques have been adopted to optimize certain confusion matrix based metrics, it is challenging or impossible in some cases to generalize the techniques to other metrics. Adversarial learning approaches have also been proposed to optimize networks via confusion matrix based metrics, but they tend to be much slower than common training methods. In this work, we propose a unifying approach to training neural network binary classifiers that combines a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function with a probabilistic view of the typical confusion matrix values using soft sets. Our theoretical analysis shows the benefit of using our method to optimize for a given evaluation metric, such as F1-Score, with soft sets. Also, our extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our approach in several domains.","tags":[],"title":"Bridging the Gap: Unifying the Training and Evaluation of Neural Network Binary Classifiers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kate Candon","Marynel V√°zquez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1646611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646611200,"objectID":"65583bd99bb20c4ce3aa4d5628d43fec","permalink":"/publication/context2-hriworkshop2022/","publishdate":"2022-07-11T23:34:30-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/context2-hriworkshop2022/","section":"publication","summary":"It is important for intelligent robots to be able to interpret human signals that provide context about how an interaction is going. We posit that including multiple facets of context,both situational and user-specific, in user models will improve a robot‚Äôs understanding of the context of their interactions. This position is supported by results from an exploratory study where humans interacted with an agent in a video game. As part of this work, we built contextual perception models that reasoned about nonverbal human reactions to prosocial assistance from the autonomous agent. Interestingly, our results showed the importance of contextualizing model predictions based on multiple factors. Future work will further examine the importance of the inclusion of the context of context, or context^2, in perception models to make intelligent predictions about nonverbal reactions through richer utilization of our existing data.
