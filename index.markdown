I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Yale University. 
I work with [Professor Marynel VÃ¡zquez](https://marynel.net) in the [Interactive Machines Group](https://interactive-machines.com/) and [Professor Brian Scassellati](http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/scaz/) in the [Social Robotics Lab](https://scazlab.yale.edu/).

I am interested in understanding how we can create interactive agents that are more effectively able to help people. My current research explores techniques to leverage multimodal implicit feedback humans provide naturally during interactions. In the future, I want to explore how to use these techniques to better understand how and when agents should ask for explicit feedback from humans during interactions.

I am excited about creating situated agents that can reason about and adapt to the preferences of the humans they interact with, creating more positive experiences for users. In particular, I want to build robots that empower seniors to remain independent by changing the way robots learn how to help.
